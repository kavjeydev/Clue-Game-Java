In this project, an input text file is given with x representing walls and o representing a valid path. Stacks and Queues
were utilized to determine if a maze had a solution or not.

One of the biggest challenges I had with this project was the smaller details that would throw errors with the maze.
For example, if the maze was trying to access an element in the _maze vector that did not exist. Or if the code was trying to pop 
an empty stack or queue. To solve this, I printed out the size of the stack/queue after every if statement to see how it was
changing. I also printed out the point that was being added/removed from the stack to keep track of where in the maze I was
at any given point.

I liked this project very much as it was almost like solving a game.
I spent around 15 hours on this project.
