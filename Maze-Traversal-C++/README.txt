2. One of the biggest challenges I had with this project was the smaller details that would throw errors with the maze.
For example if the maze was trying to access an element in the _maze vector that did not exist. Or if the code was trying to pop 
an empty stack or queue. To solve this, I printed out the size of the stack/queue after every if statement to see how it was
changing. I also printed out the point that was being added/removed from the stack to keep track of where in the maze I was
at any given point.
3. I liked this projecct very much as it was almost like solving a game. I think it would be better if it was more clear
on how we are supposed to use stacks and queues to contain the points in the maze.
4. I spent around 15 hours on this assignment.
