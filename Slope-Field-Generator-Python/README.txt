This project takes a user input, ex: "dy/dx = x^2" and outputs a slope field corresponding to the user input.

The SlopeFieldGenerator taught me the basics of Python, strengthened my understanding of string manipulation,
and gave me a basic understanding of Python graphics. 

I spent approximately 3 hours on this project.
