This is a project in which different data structures were utilized to create a hangman game where the computer tries to make the user lose. 

The biggest challenge I encountered was choosing which data structure to use to split up the dictionary into separate families. I also had some trouble changing the display word to reflect what was shown in each family. 

I liked the concept behind the project, a hangman that people cannot win with a reasonable amount of guesses was a good idea. 

However, deciding what data structure we could use made it pretty difficult. 

I spent about 19 hours working on this project.
